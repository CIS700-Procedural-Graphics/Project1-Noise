# [Project 1: Noise](https://github.com/CIS700-Procedural-Graphics/Project1-Noise)

## Overview

A music visualizer "blob" with lambertian and ambient shading.

## Noise Application

Used multi-octave noise for the displacement of vertices on the icosahedron, as well as some cloud-like coloring on the surface of the icosaherdron.

## Interactivity

Added an amplitude parameter to adjust how much the vertices are displaced as the frequency of music fluctuates.

## For the overachievers (extra credit)

Reads in music and takes the average frequency at a current time as a parameter of the displacement of vertices.
